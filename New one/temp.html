                        How To Read Manga online?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        As manga originates from Japan, the easiest way to read it is to know the language. However, as you are here, we assume that Japanese might not be one of the languages you can read proficiently. But don't sweat it, all mangas on MangaReader are in English for your convenience.</p><p class="content">
                        Reading manga can be different from reading a comic, book, or magazine, especially when it is traditional Japanese manga. The main reason for this is that kanji, the Japanese writing, is read right to left. So when you pick up a manga volume to read, you need to start with the frame (a.k.a koma) in the upper right-hand corner and end a page with the koma in the bottom left-hand corner. Most publishers retain the original format of the manga; therefore, it is important to know this first rule.

                        Where To Read Manga For Free?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        Despite growing demand, manga is not easily available outside of Japan and once they are, they are expensive. It makes total sense as they are copyrighted audiovisual products/translated works. In the US, mangas cost you from 8 to 20 USD, sometimes more. Not everyone can afford to pay such a large amount of money for a volume unless their hobby is to collect manga. But as we stated above, MangaReader is created in hopes that every manga fan can get to read manga without paying a dime, this site is completely free of charge. To read manga online for free, all you need to do is to visit MangaReader, search for the manga you want to watch, and enjoy reading it at no cost and with no risk.
